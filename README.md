<b>ABOUT THE CHALLENGE</b>
<p>“Artificial Intelligence for ALL” is one of the National AI strategies in India. This hackathon
aims to expand the idea to meet the 2030 agenda for Sustainable Development, adopted by all
United Nations Member States for peace and prosperity for people and the planet, now and
into the future. At its heart are the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which are an
