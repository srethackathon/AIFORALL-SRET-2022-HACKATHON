# HACK@SRET-2022
<b>ABOUT THE CHALLENGE</b>
<p>“Artificial Intelligence for ALL” is one of the National AI strategies in India. This hackathon
aims to expand the idea to meet the 2030 agenda for Sustainable Development, adopted by all
United Nations Member States for peace and prosperity for people and the planet, now and
into the future. At its heart are the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which are an
urgent call for action by all countries - developed and developing - in a global partnership.
You can collaborate, experiment and build the brightest solution to tackle SDG goals through
AI with your team and mentors.
The advent of artificial intelligence (AI) and its ever greater impact on numerous sectors,
necessitates an assessment of its impact on the achievement of the Sustainable Development
Goals (SDGs). Combining AI and SDGs will assist all industries in designing a better planet
that meets present demands, while not jeopardising future generations due to climate change
or other big concerns.</p>
